Behind her back she's Gentleman Jack
A Yorkshire lady of renown
She's ever so fine, but she won't toe the line
Upon her name the gentlemen frown

At Shibden Hall she had them all
The fairer sex fell under her spell
Dapper and bright, she held them tight
Handsome Anne seduced them well

Gentleman Jack, oh Gentleman Jack
Watch your back, you're under attack
Their husbands are coming, you'd better start running
For nobody likes a Jack-the-Lass

Jack-the-lass, Jack-the-Lass
No-one likes a Jack-the-Lass
The code is cracked, your bags are packed
The knives are out for Gentleman Jack

Proud and stout with standing and clout
She played the fellas at their game
Ambitious of mind, she's one of a kind
Her devilish ways the men couldn't tame

Hidden away, revealed today
4 million words in diaries found
Motives exposed in a baffling code
Romantic yearnings all leather bound
